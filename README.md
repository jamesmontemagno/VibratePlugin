### Migrate to: [Xamarin.Essentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/essentials/index?WT.mc_id=friends-0000-jamont) or [.NET MAUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/platform-integration/?WT.mc_id=friends-0000-jamont)

I have been working on Plugins for Xamarin for a long time now. Through the years I have always wanted to create a single, optimized, and official package from the Xamarin team at Microsoft that could easily be consumed by any application. The time is now with [Xamarin.Essentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/essentials/index?WT.mc_id=friends-0000-jamont), which offers over 50 cross-platform native APIs in a single optimized package. I worked on this new library with an amazing team of developers and I highly highly highly recommend you check it out. 

Additionally, Xamarin.Essentials is now included in & [.NET MAUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/platform-integration/?WT.mc_id=friends-0000-jamont).

Due to the functionality being included "in the box" I have decided to officially archive this repo.

### Platform Support

|Platform|Version|
| ------------------- | :------------------: |
|Xamarin.iOS|iOS 7+|
|Xamarin.Android|API 10+|
|Windows 10 UWP|10+|


### API Usage

To gain access to the Vibrate class simply use this method:

```csharp
var v = CrossVibrate.Current;
v.Vibration(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1)); // 1 second vibration
```

#### Methods

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Vibrate the phone for specified amount of time
/// </summary>
/// <param name="vibrateSpan">Time to vibrate. 500ms is default</param>
void Vibration(TimeSpan? vibrateSpan = null);
```


#### Platform Tweaks

**iOS**
There is no API to vibrate for a specific amount of time, so it will vibrate for the default time the system specifies (around 500 milliseconds)..

**Android**
The `android.permission.VIBRATE` permission will automatically be added for you into your AndroidManifest.xml
